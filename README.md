# Predict the next word

This is a project to pass the Data science capstone, also you can find a simply way 
in how through n grams and NLP you can build a model to predict in base the last words 
what should be the next word to write.

#The root's files are to:

- Read our dataset, it was delivered by course tools.
- Clean the data, to clean the data was do with Courpus and TM libraries
- Make an exploratory analysis with cloud word plot
- Built ngrams models
- Get freq of each ngram file and store those in RData files
- An function to predict the next word in base of our models and frequencies 

#our App:

- On the App you will be able to find just the readiness of our models and the predict function into server.R
- ui.R has all the objects to will be render on a web page.
